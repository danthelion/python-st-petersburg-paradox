The St. Petersburg paradox or St. Petersburg lottery is a paradox related to probability and decision theory in economics.

It is based on a particular (theoretical) lottery game that leads to a random variable with infinite expected value (i.e., infinite expected payoff)

but nevertheless seems to be worth only a very small amount to the participants.

The St. Petersburg paradox is a situation where a naive decision criterion which takes only the expected value into account predicts a course of action that presumably no actual person would be willing to take.

Several resolutions are possible.
